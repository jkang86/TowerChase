This program will be creating a 15 by 15 grid using 2D arrays to encapsulate a game similar to the chase simulation. This game is called Tower Chase and it is a game that has enemies chase you continuously until you meet the end goal. “YOU” is the character you will be playing as and there will be enemies randomly spawned around the grid that will chase you called “EMI”. You, the player, will have to complete the objective of getting to the bottom right, “END”, while the enemies chase you. This will be a game involving a one shot system, meaning that if you get tackled by an enemy or if you tackle an enemy, you will be forced to restart the system in order to play again; i.e, the objective of the game is to run away, not fight. The movement will work differently for the enemy and the character. “YOU” will be able to move in a direction based on user input by the user, so right, left, down, up, will happen by typing that direction. “YOU” will move two spaces rather than one, to have an advantage in the early game, but harder as the levels continue on. Enemy will move one space, unlike “YOU”, and the direction of where the enemy will go will be completely randomized. The enemy will have a 50/50 chance to either move in the x-direction or y-direct, and it will get closer to the character according to which side “YOU” is to “EMI”, so if “YOU” is to the top right of “EMI”, it will either go right or up according to the randomized direction. There will also be a level system to this game, meaning that each time you reach the end goal, “END”, you will start a new level. This new level will increase by two enemies and will also be randomly spawned. There will be no level cap to the game, so the user will lose this game eventually, and will be forced to restart if wanting to play again. SO GOOD LUCK!!!
